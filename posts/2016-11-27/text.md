A couple of months ago I was contacted by a recruiter via linkedin from a company called 10gen. I didn’t think much of it at the time but I did end up responding with my resume and I was soon going through the motions of an interview process with MongoDB.

There were two main interview steps, a video interview with a hiring manager from the New York office and a face-to-face on-site interview. I won’t go into the details of the actual interview but I will say that the on-site interview took almost 4 hours and I was very nervous throughout it. The interviewers were very supportive and cared more about the process of how I approached a problem rather than what the answer is. I thought that worked in my favour because I’m more of a problem-solver than anything else.

In preparation for the interview I did a lot of things to hone my skills. I practiced programming tasks, read through data-structures/algorithms and worked on a variety of puzzles. Project Euler, is a particularly good site as is Code Chef for programming practice.

It’s been a couple of months now that I’ve been in my position.I’ve met all kinds of people, intelligent, competent and incredibly genuine humans. Small talk is pointless because everyone cares deeply about what they do. It’s at the heart of what drives the engineering of the company. Being intellectually honest is one of the core values of MongoDB and I think that’s speaks a great deal of the quality of work we do.

In my first few weeks, I was feeling quite intimidated and overwhelmed being surrounded by such amazing people but our training supervisor in New York put me at ease. He said that everyone who comes here questions how they were offered a position and managed to slip through the cracks in this company among so much genius and talent. But it’s not about that. It’s about everyone working together and building a team full of people that care about the work that they do and the quality of that work. It’s an environment where everyone wants you to be the best and happiest employee. We are more than the sum of our parts and collaboration is the key to success.

I’ll conclude with one of the most intriguing puzzles I’ve come across while preparing for the interview. It’s by XKCD and it’s called <a href="https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html" target="_blank">Blue Eyes: The Hardest Logic Puzzle in the World</a>.
