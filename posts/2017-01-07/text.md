Notifications are everywhere, from social media to mobile apps and the plethora of messaging apps. We are slaves to them as the Dilbert comic on June 19, 2016 insinuates:

It wasn’t always like this, there was a time when the only sort of notification was a new email, phone call or a tap on a shoulder.

Now it is quite overwhelming dealing with notifications from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, news sites, apps, the list goes on and on. Who thought this was a good idea?

The problem is, everyone did and does. The moment people came to realise that advertisements can be converted to money everyone wanted to hop on that bandwagon and reap the financial benefits because creating artificial demand is good for the economy. Notifications were just a side-effect of the advertising extending its tentacles further on to society.

However this deluge of notifications does have an effect on us mere mortals. Our minds are constantly bombarded with directed information that tempts us to divert our attention to whatever forces beckon. This constant stream of divergent information is distracting and can affect mood, concentration and lead to mental fatigue. It gets worse because our minds are more elastic the younger we are; it can adapt to this constant flood of information. Eventually,  the lack of notifications will seem like an abnormal state, similar to withdrawal symptoms.

That is because the instant gratification via notifications provides a fix that triggers the reward centers of the brain. The effect of excessive notifications is very much akin to that of addiction. There was a recent episode of Black Mirror where likes formed a social status driven economy that could be traded for access to a better lifestyle based on a threshold rating. It’s a sort of achievement driven economy built on sending and receiving notifications.

There were several moments in that episode where the primary character, Lacie Pound, could be seen to exhale with a deep sense of relief as if receiving a better rating gave her some sort of pleasure response. This describes an extreme case of the detriments of notifications but it is an exaggeration of a prevalent issue. For many people, and this is especially true for teenagers, their sense of self-worth is driven by how the world beyond responds to their presence. Carrying a phone that constantly gives feedback via notifications advertisements and news feeds provides exactly this. This instant gratification is not healthy; our physiology isn’t designed for next to zero delay between stimulus and response.

This is not to say that all notifications are bad. There is a flip side to this, with notifications adding structure to our daily lives via calendars, reminders and events. Social event notifications triggered by location proximity, especially while traveling, can be incredibly engaging and spontaneous. There are benefits to notifications where we can defer the information we need to a later point in time when we actually need it. We don’t need to rely on our memory, we delegate to our devices and the omnipresent cloud to provide us with the right information when we need it and that frees our head space to focus solely on the moment.

Notifications are based on the publisher/subscriber pattern where app platforms publish content and users may opt to subscribe to the content. As a user we can choose to receive notifications. We can choose what kind of feedback we receive and how much. For instance some mobile apps like Twitter and Medium have a digest option to send the highlights of the past 24 hours in a single notification. This staggers the amount of notifications we receive rather than the sporadic bits throughout the day. For other apps there is the option to completely disable all notifications and this can also be finely controlled by blocking out notifications at certain times of the day.

The point is we can control the sort of notifications we subscribe to in our lives and there is a healthy balance between productivity, engagement and information.
